        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        
        <p>
            If you're under the age required to manage your own account, 
            you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission to use an 
            account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these 
            terms with you. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            If you're a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to 
            use the services, then these terms apply to you and you're 
            responsible for your child's activity on the services.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Some services have additional age requirements as described 
            in their service-specific additional terms and policies.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these
            terms, including:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>apps and sites (like Search and Maps)</li>
            <li>platforms (like Google Shopping)</li>
            <li>integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies' 
                apps or sites)</li>
            <li>devices (like Google Nest)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Many of these services also include content that you can stream or
            interact with.
        </p>

        <p> 
            Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you 
            to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar 
            event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps 
            can show you how to get there.
