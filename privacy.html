        <p>
            We collect information to provide better services to all our users  
            from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more 
            complex things like which ads you will find most useful, the people 
            who matter most to you online, or which videos you might 
            like. The information we collect, and how that information is 
            used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your 
            privacy controls.

            When you are not signed in to an account, we store the 
            information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, 
            application, or device you are using. This allows us to do things 
            like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as 
            your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search 
            results or ads based on your activity.

            When you are signed in, we also collect information that we store 
            with your account, which we treat as personal information.
